<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was initialized by Narendra Kurnia Putra S.T, M.T., Ph.D. and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonfilio-nainggolan-12508415a/">Bonfilio Nainggolan</a> as Bonfilio's undergraduate thesis project in 2021. Back then, the purpose of this project was to analyse the effect of flow diverter stent therapy using single stent lay  er and the result was published on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9624474">here</a>.

For further improvement, this project is extended to analyze the effect of double stent therapy using CFD.
